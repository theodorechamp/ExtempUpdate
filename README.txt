This Program was created by Theodore A Champ in 2015. With it, he broke at every tournament that year for extemp except for fairview, including 1st place at Nat Quals. Not only does it work, but it takes almost 0 effort. 

Its basic purpose is to download articles from Al Jazeera, BBC, and NPR. The model could certainly be used for other news agencies and I encourage anyone to work on it to do so.

Disclaimers: Theodore has no interest in supporting this program further. As such, anyone is welcome to make improvements, which is why the project is included in this folder. But, the code is poorly commented, if at all, so good luck.

User Guide:
IMPORTANT NOTE: In order for this program to work, the user must first create three folders in their Documents: "Al_Jazeera", "BBC", and "NPR". IF THOSE FOLDER DO NOT EXIST, THE PROGRAM WILL NOT WORK. I recommend keeping all the files in another location on the computer, then copying over files from the three folders when the update is finished. This will add a level of redudancy and make searching easier.


In order to operate the program, one only has to double click the .jar file entitled Extemp Update. A dialog should appear with a progress bar and a list of files should appear. With PSD wifi and a school laptop, it take about 10 minutes for a full update. The user can continue to use their computer as they normally would just keep in mind this may slow it down. At the end, a finish dialog should appear which the user clicks ok to exit. This exists to let them know if the program ran successfully. If either of these dialogs did not appear, likely something is wrong and the files did not update. Consider running it in cmd in order to see errors that occurred.

Note on using files:
The files created by the program are .txt files, similar to this one. As a result, if opened in notepad, they will be unreadable. It is much easier to read through them if the user sets their default program to "WordPad". To do so, right click on any .txt file in your computer, hover over "Open with", then click "Choose Default program." Finally, select WordPad from the list.

A user could use Microsoft Word rather than Word pad for viewing files, but I found that to be much slower and as a result, I would not recommend.
